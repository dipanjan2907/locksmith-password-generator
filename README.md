Modes

Checkbox Mode: Choose which character sets to include; guarantees at least one character from each selected set.

Special Type Mode: Automatically generates a balanced password using uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers for strong security.

Cryptographically Secure Randomness

Uses crypto.getRandomValues() for generating secure random numbers instead of Math.random().

Each character and PIN digit is selected securely, ensuring unpredictability.
